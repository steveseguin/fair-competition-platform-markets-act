## Apple isn't capitalism.

Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, investments determined by private decision, and prices, production, and the distribution of goods determined primarily by competition in a free market.

Competition and consumer are two defining aspects of capitalism:

Consumer Choice: Consumers have the freedom to choose from various products and services, influencing what is produced in the economy based on their preferences and willingness to pay.

Competition: Businesses compete with each other to provide goods and services, striving to attract customers by offering better quality, lower prices, or other advantages.

Apple does not allow choice or competition with key aspects of their business, and as a result, they have funneled endless wealth into their pockets. The App store, iMessage, Apple Pay are just the obvious examples, but NFC, trackers, bluetooth headphones, iCloud alternatives, and xcode are more examples of limiting access or features to make fair competition impossible.

I can go into detail for each item, of how they abuse their monopoly, but let's just look specifically at Safari on iOS. If you install Chrome on iOS, it's not actually Chrome; it's just Safari with a skin to make it look like Chrome. Apple does not allow for third-party browser engines, and no where does Apple make it clear. Then Apple proceeds to hinder and break the open-web, by limiting its browser, introducing countless bugs, and not following web standards - users and developers have no choice but to release products and services as native apps instead. Apple has largely been responsible for the death of the open-web.

and I do consider Apple a monopoly. When a company eliminates or restricts the choice of competition, it is typically referred to as creating a "monopoly." A monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity or service. In a monopolistic market, the monopolist faces little to no competition and therefore can wield considerable control over the market.

There are some solutions, but mainly just cracking down on unfair practices would be a start.

For example, do not allow a company that owns or controls a market platform to compete against those on that platform. This would apply to grocery stores, e-commerce sites, and app stores. This is a big change on its own, as Walmart and Amazon would both need to sell off its own in-store-brands, or it would need to only carry its own brands; nothing else.

In the case of Apple, iCloud, iMessage, Apple Music, Apple Maps, and a slew of other apps would suddenly need to be removed or sold off. Apple might just try banning all Music/Maps/Messenger apps on the App stores as a result, to claim it has no competition, but an App is an App, and limiting what types of Apps can be made, in preference of their own, should not be allowed.

I'd claim also that Bluetooth on Apple devices is also a platform, and by Apple not treating all Bluetooth devices or audio devices for that matter fairly, rather preferencing their own devices in different ways, it also becomes an unfair monopoly. Apple even selling its own headphones is unfair competition, and the same goes with mice and keyboards. While Apple would then try to just get away with allowing open-access to some of their restricted APIs (ie: W1 chip), it's not enough; you can't trust these companies; they simply should not be allowed to compete when they are also in control.

There probably could be an exception carved out, for when an accessory is required for the basic device to function, like a power plug, controller, or battery, the company can include their own option in the purchase, and make it available for sale, for those seeking replacements, etc. 

While this all sounds rather extreme, Apple would be forced to break up its company into several smaller companies. The result is a state of fair competition, and while it might be shocking to see a massive building collapse, what's more shocking is how we've all allowed such a large building to be built in the first place; one that blocks out even the sun from everyone else below.

Tech giants that step on the small guy, prevent innovation, and gather up extreme wealth could be taken down. Not destroyed, but something the rest of us can then compete with. Fairly. and when you have fair competition, you have fair wages, fair prices, and my favourite part, real innovation. Not the same block of metal for 20-years that everyone seems fine with, as for those too young not remember, we we're all fine with rotary phones at some point in the past as well; the result of an AT&T monopoly in long the past.

Something better awaits after Apple.
