# Fair Competition in Platform Markets Act 2024

## Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the "Fair Competition in Platform Markets Act of 2024."

## Section 2: Findings and Purpose
### (a) Findings:
The Congress finds that:
1. The dominance of certain entities in controlling market platforms while also competing within these platforms undermines fair competition.
2. Such practices can lead to monopolistic behavior, stifling innovation, and disadvantaging smaller competitors.

### (b) Purpose:
The purpose of this Act is to establish regulations that ensure fair competition on market platforms controlled by a single entity.

## Section 3: Definitions
In this Act:
1. **"Market Platform":** Refers to any physical or digital venue, device, or ecosystem, including but not limited to app stores, e-commerce sites, physical retail spaces, electronic devices, and software ecosystems, where goods or services are offered or accessed. This includes platforms where a controlling entity and/or multiple third-party entities offer or sell goods or services, and platforms or devices where a controlling entity may offer exclusive goods, services, or functionalities.
2. **"Controlling Entity"**: Refers to any person or entity that has control over a Market Platform.
3. **"Competitor"**: Refers to any person or entity other than the controlling entity that offers or seeks to offer goods or services on the Market Platform.
4. **"Open Access":** Refers to the principle of allowing access to a Market Platform for all competitors.

## Section 4: Prohibition of Unfair Competitive Practices
### (a) General Prohibition:
It shall be unlawful for a Controlling Entity of a Market Platform to:
1. Compete directly with other entities within its own Market Platform, except in the following situations:
   - **Integral Software and Hardware for Basic Operation:** Software and hardware that are integral to the basic operation of the device, subject to the following conditions:
     - **Limited Scope for Software:** The software must provide only basic functionalities necessary for the operation of the hardware, without advanced features that might compete with third-party apps.
     - **Basic Hardware Inclusion:** Hardware included with the device must be essential for its immediate functionality (e.g., basic headphones with an MP3 player, tires on a car, a standard controller with a gaming console). This does not extend to advanced or premium versions of these hardware items that directly compete with third-party products.
     - **No Unfair Promotion:** The controlling entity must not unfairly promote or prioritize their basic software or hardware over third-party alternatives.
     - **Equal Access to System Resources:** Basic software should not have exclusive access to system resources or capabilities that are not equally available to third-party apps.
   - **Absence of Feasible Alternatives:** Situations where no feasible alternative exists. This includes:
     - **For Digital Platforms:** Prohibit the controlling entity’s products or services if alternatives are available from third parties, except when no feasible alternative exists.
     - **For Physical Retail Spaces:** Prohibit store-branded products if alternatives are available, except when no feasible alternative exists.
     - **For Hardware Devices:** Limit pre-installed software and included hardware to functionalities and items for which no feasible alternative exists and are necessary for the device’s operation.
2. Engage in any practice that unfairly disadvantages competitors on its platform. This includes but is not limited to:
   - **Exclusionary Practices:** Implementing policies or actions that exclude or limit the presence of competitor products or services when alternatives to the controlling entity’s offerings exist.
   - **Manipulation of Platform Features:** Unfairly leveraging platform features or resources to benefit the controlling entity’s products or services at the expense of competitors.

### (b) Special Provisions for Emerging Markets and Technologies:
1. **Initial Development Phase:** A temporary special period will be granted to the Controlling Entity that develops a new market platform, during which they will allowed to compete on that market platform, like an electric vehicle charging network, when no reasonable alternatives exist.
2. **Proactive Transition to Competitive Market:** The temporary special period will end based on market maturity, the controlling entity’s market share, and other factors; not solely on the emergence of direct competitors on the market platform or other market platforms. This includes:
   - **Market Maturity Assessment:** The appropriate regulatory body (e.g., Federal Trade Commission) shall periodically assess the market's maturity, considering factors like the controlling entity's market share, the potential for competition, and technological advancements.
   - **Mandatory Measures for Market Opening:** Depending on the assessment, the Controlling Entity may be required to:
     - Implement measures to facilitate market entry for new competitors, such as providing access to essential patents under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
     - Prepare for the potential divestiture of the relevant division if it's determined that the entity's control over the market hinders the development of a competitive landscape.

### (c) Special Provisions for Proprietary Technologies and Infrastructure:
1. **Exclusive Use vs. Market Platform:** 
   - If a Controlling Entity uses its proprietary technology or infrastructure (e.g., a charging network) exclusively for its own products or services, and does not allow for any third-party access, it will not be considered a market platform. It may still howver be considered a monopoly if it gains excessive market dominance, subjecting it to antitrust regulations, however that falls outside the scope of this Act.
   - If the Controlling Entity opens its proprietary technology or infrastructure to third parties, it becomes a market platform and must comply with the provisions of this Act.
2. **Incentivizing the Opening of Proprietary Systems:** 
   - **Exclusive Control Period:** To encourage entities to convert proprietary systems into market platforms, a temporary period of exclusive control may be granted. During this period, the entity may compete on their market platform, however they must demonstrate efforts to compete fairly and prepare the platform for open access.
   - **Transition to Open Access:** Following the exclusivity period, the Controlling Entity must abide by the this act in full, even if that results in the potential divestiture of the relevant divisions.

### (d) Balancing Innovation and Competition:
1. **Encouraging Infrastructure Development:** Recognizing the importance of innovation and infrastructure development, this Act aims to balance the need for entities to recoup their investment and incentivize new technologies, while ensuring that these developments do not hinder the growth of competitive markets.
2. **Regulatory Oversight:** The appropriate regulatory body shall have the authority to assess whether a technology or infrastructure has moved beyond the scope of a traditional monopoly and requires the implementation of fair market platform practices.

## Section 5: Enforcement and Penalties
### (a) Enforcement:
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shall enforce the provisions of this Act.

### (b) Penalties:
Violation of any provision of this Act shall subject the Controlling Entity to:
1. Civil penalties, including fines determined by the severity of the violation, not exceeding $1 million per violation.
2. Mandatory divestiture of parts of their business if necessary to restore fair competition.
3. Injunctions or other equitable relief as deemed appropriate by the court.

## Section 6: Exceptions and Exemptions
### (a) Exceptions:
This Act shall not apply to:
1. **Essential Operations Exception:**
   - **Initial Functionality Inclusion:** Products or services provided by the Controlling Entity that are necessary to use the device or platform in its intended form at the time of purchase. This includes components like game controllers for a gaming console or basic headphones for an MP3 player, which are required to use the device in its most basic intended form at the time of purchase.



## Section 6: Exceptions and Exemptions
### (a) Exceptions:
1. **Essential Operations Exception:**
   - **Basic Functionality Inclusion:** Products or services provided by the Controlling Entity that are required to use the device in its most basic intended form at the time of purchase. This includes core system applications like a basic camera to make use of a built-in camera, or components like a bluetooth game controller for a game console. However, these inclusion should not possess exclusive access to system capabilities that are not equally available to third-party apps or devices.
   - **Competitive Alternatives:** This exception does not extend to additional, non-essential products or services where competitive alternatives are feasible and practical. For instance, while including a standard game controller or basic headphones is permissible, offering enhanced versions of these accessories that directly compete with third-party products would not be allowed.
   - **Application Availability:** This exception does not cover applications or services that makes use of the Internet, where competitive alternatives providing similar functionalities are reasonably accessible at time of use. This includes, but is not limited to, cloud storage services, web browsers, and messaging apps that make use of Internet access.
   - **User Choice and Default Settings:**  Pre-installed applications should not be given undue advantage in terms of system integration or permissions that are not equally accessible to third-party applications, including as being specified as the default app for services.
2. **Public Interest Exception:** Entities or services deemed essential for national security, public safety, or other critical public interests.

### (b) General Guidelines for Fair Platform Practices:
1. **Equal Access and Non-Discrimination:** Controlling Entities must provide equal access and non-discriminatory treatment to all competitors on their platforms. This includes fair access to services, resources, and opportunities essential for competition.
2. **Transparency in Operations:** Clear and accessible information must be provided regarding the criteria and policies that govern the operation of the platform, including how products or services are featured, prioritized, or restricted.
3. **Fairness in Competition:** Controlling Entities are prohibited from leveraging their platform control to give undue advantage to their own products or services. This encompasses practices like preferential listing, exclusionary tactics, or manipulation of search results or recommendations.

## Section 7: Implementation and Review
### (a) Implementation:
The provisions of this Act shall be implemented within 180 days of its enactment.

### (b) Regular Review:
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shall conduct a review every two years to assess the effectiveness of this Act and recommend any necessary amendments.
