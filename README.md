draft proposal v0.0.4 - updated to The Platform Integrity and Structural Separation Act of 2025

## The Platform Integrity and Structural Separation Act of 2025

### Section 1: Short Title

This Act may be cited as the "Platform Integrity and Structural Separation Act of 2025."

### Section 2: Core Principle and Purpose

**(a) Principle:** This Act is founded on the principle that an entity controlling a critical market platform shall not be permitted to compete with businesses and individuals who rely on that platform for market access. The inherent conflict of interest is irreconcilable with the principles of fair competition and open markets.

**(b) Purpose:** The purpose of this Act is not to manage anti-competitive behavior, but to prevent it entirely by mandating a clear structural separation between platform operation and platform participation for the largest and most influential market platforms.

### Section 3: Definitions

1.  **"Designated Platform":** A digital or physical market platform is automatically designated under this Act if the entity that owns or controls it meets **any two** of the following criteria in the preceding two fiscal years:
    * (i) Has more than $20 billion in total annual revenue in the United States.
    * (ii) Has a market capitalization of more than $500 billion.
    * (iii) Has more than 50 million monthly active individual users or 100,000 monthly active business users on any single platform it operates.
2.  **"Controlling Entity":** The person or entity that owns or exercises control over a Designated Platform.
3.  **"Platform Participant":** Any third-party person or entity that offers or seeks to offer goods, services, or software on a Designated Platform.

### Section 4: Absolute Prohibition of Dual-Mode Operation

**(a) General Prohibition:** It shall be unlawful for a Controlling Entity of a Designated Platform to offer for sale, or otherwise have a direct or indirect financial interest in, any product, service, or software that uses the Designated Platform to reach end-users.

**(b) Scope of Prohibition:** This prohibition is absolute and applies regardless of whether the product or service competes with any specific Platform Participant. It includes, but is not limited to:
    * For e-commerce sites: The sale of store-branded or private-label products.
    * For app stores: The offering of any applications, in-app payment systems, or subscription services by the Controlling Entity.
    * For operating systems: The pre-installation of any non-essential applications developed by the Controlling Entity that could reasonably be offered by a third party. "Essential" is strictly limited to software required for the initial boot-up and basic hardware functionality (e.g., settings menus, diagnostic tools).
    * For hardware ecosystems: The sale of accessories or peripherals (e.g., headphones, chargers, cases) that connect to the primary device.

**(c) No Exception for "Absence of Alternatives":** The Controlling Entity may not use the argument that no feasible alternative exists as a defense. If no alternative exists, the market is open for a Platform Participant to create one.

### Section 5: Enforcement by Structural Mandate, Not Regulatory Discretion

**(a) Compliance and Divestiture:**
1.  Any entity that meets the criteria for a Controlling Entity shall have 180 days from the enactment of this Act, or from the date they meet the criteria, to submit a compliance plan to the Department of Justice (DOJ).
2.  The compliance plan must detail the complete divestiture, spin-off, or shutdown of all business units that violate Section 4. The entity must choose to be either a platform operator or a product/service provider, not both.
3.  The full divestiture must be completed within one year of the submission of the compliance plan.

**(b) Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
1.  Failure to submit a compliant plan will result in a fine of 2% of global daily revenue for each day of delay.
2.  Failure to execute the divestiture plan within the one-year timeframe will result in a fine of up to 15% of the entity's total global revenue and may trigger forced dissolution of the non-compliant business units by the DOJ.

### Section 6: Empowering Direct Action and Eliminating Delays

**(a) Private Right of Action:**
1.  Any Platform Participant or potential Platform Participant who believes a Controlling Entity is in violation of Section 4 of this Act may bring a civil action in any federal district court.
2.  Courts are empowered to grant immediate injunctive relief to halt the prohibited activity.
3.  If the suit is successful, the plaintiff is entitled to recover treble damages, court costs, and attorney's fees.

**(b) Presumption of Illegality and Burden of Proof:**
1.  In any legal proceeding, if an entity meets the definition of a Controlling Entity under Section 3, its participation as a seller on its own platform shall be presumed illegal.
2.  The burden of proof is entirely on the Controlling Entity to demonstrate that it does not meet the clear, objective criteria laid out in Section 3. No other defense shall be admissible.

### Section 7: Prohibiting Malicious Compliance and Circumvention

**(a) Spirit and Intent:** This Act shall be interpreted to fulfill its stated purpose of structural separation. Any scheme, design, or artifice to circumvent the prohibitions of this Act while adhering to its literal text shall be treated as a direct violation.

**(b) Examples of Prohibited Circumvention:**
1.  Establishing complex subsidiary structures or holding companies to obscure ownership of a competing business.
2.  Entering into exclusive marketing or distribution agreements with a "preferred" partner that is a de facto proxy for the Controlling Entity.
3.  Designing platform features or APIs in a way that only a specific, notionally separate company can realistically use, thereby recreating the prohibited self-preferencing.

**(c) Severe Penalties for Circumvention:** A finding of malicious compliance or circumvention shall subject the Controlling Entity to the maximum penalties allowable under this Act and may result in a temporary (up to one year) suspension of the entity's right to operate any Designated Platform in the United States.
