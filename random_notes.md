Parts to repair a car, or phone, or whatever are often available as after-market.

A company may not intend its products to be repaired with non-OEM components, but rather be the sole supplier

Repair parts are not really a market platform, even though you might buy parts from a market platform, so I don't really think this is an issue.

That said, things that might make it harder for end users to get replacement parts for their products isn't desirable; rather the opposite.  Ideally, making it easier to self-repair is preferable, so it should be kept in mind with final review of any act.
