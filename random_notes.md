Parts to repair a car, or phone, or whatever are often available as after-market.

A company may not intend its products to be repaired with non-OEM components, but rather be the sole supplier

Repair parts are not really a market platform, even though you might buy parts from a market platform, so I don't really think this is an issue.

That said, things that might make it harder for end users to get replacement parts for their products isn't desirable; rather the opposite.  Ideally, making it easier to self-repair is preferable, so it should be kept in mind with final review of any act.

Apple will always find a way to be a fucker.  I can see how Apple will do what it does with Mac OS, where you need your app signed by Apple to get them installable. Apple can pull apps this way, market them as unsafe, and perhaps blackmail payment to maintain "in good standing", else the signing account will be revoked. we'll see tho

Attempts at malicious compliance to the act should be explicitly mentioned, and note that such behaviour will be liable to fines and/or further punishment
